## Game rules
The basic rules of classic Tic-Tac-Toe still apply, that is:

* A player must play with and **O** and a second player with and **X**.

* The first player who manages to align 3 **O** or 3 **X** in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line, wins.

### New rules added in this game:

* The first player decides what board to play in and in which cell. The second player must play in the board that corresponds to the cell selected by the first player. For example, if player 1 puts a O in the cell 2 of the central board, the player 2 must play in any position of the positions of the board 2.

* If a board is completed, that is, if a player wins in the board following the classic rules, the board is now locked .

* If a player has to play in a locked cell, that player can choose any of the non-locked boards to play his move.

* If any board is declared as a draw, the previous rule will applies the same (it becomes a locked board).

* The player who manages to win 3 boards in a row filling the with **O** or **X** in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line, wins. (That is, for example, winning the board 1, 3 and 9)
